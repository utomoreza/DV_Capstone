## Aim and Objectives

This project aims to display plot variations from air traffic data, for example airlines, destination airports, flights, fleets, and weather, from three airports in New York City, i.e. LaGuardia Airport (LGA), John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), in 2013.

Meanwhile, the objectives of the project are as follows:

1. To show a map pointing air traffics from the three
2. To communicate comparison of total number of flights among the three
3. To communicate comparison of total number of flights of each airline at each of the three
4. To convey data distribution of air time of flights departing from the three on each of them
5. To convey data distribution of year manufactured of each airline's fleets operating at the three
6. To convey data distribution of aircraft brands routinely purchased by various airlines
7. To exhibit top aircraft manufacturers whose products frequently experience delays in flight departing from the three
8. To communicate comparison of weather conditions at the three
9. To communicate the relationship/correlation between delays and weather conditions of flights at the three
10. To exhibit the data used in table forms

## Structure of the Dashboard

In overall, the dashboard consists of four pages, i.e. air traffic, fleet, weather, dan data. The ir traffic page shows charts regarding the traffic of flights, the fleet page shows those regarding aircraft fleets, the weather page displays those about the weather conditions, whereas the data page exhibit the data in table forms.

### `Data` Page

# Dataset

The dataset used comes from a built-in R package internally, i.e. `nycflights13`. This package consist of 5 dataframes as follows:

1. `airlines`: Look up airline names from their carrier codes.
2. `airports`: Useful metadata about airports.
3. `flights`: On-time data for all flights that departed NYC (i.e. JFK, LGA or EWR) in 2013.
4. `planes`: Plane metadata for all plane tailnumbers found in the FAA aircraft registry.   American Airways(AA) and Envoy Air (MQ) report fleet numbers rather than tail numbers so canâ€™t be matched.
5. `weather` Hourly meterological data for LGA, JFK and EWR.

For more information regarding metadata of the dataset, you can read more here in [the metadata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf).

# Preparation

First of all, load all necessary packages.

```{r, results=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

Save the dataframes from `nycflights13` to dataframe objects in `Global Environment`.

```{r}
airlines <- as.data.frame(nycflights13::airlines)
airports <- as.data.frame(nycflights13::airports)
flights <- as.data.frame(nycflights13::flights)
planes <- as.data.frame(nycflights13::planes)
weather <- as.data.frame(nycflights13::weather)
```

Let's take a quick look at all dataframes.

```{r}
head(airlines)
head(airports)
head(flights)
head(planes)
head(weather)
```

Well done. Our data ready for the next section.

# Data Pre-processing

## Remove NA Values

Firstly, let's check whether NA exist in the tables.

* NA Values in `airlines`

```{r}
is.na(airlines) %>% colSums()
```

Good! All clean.

* NA Values in `airports`

```{r}
is.na(airports) %>% colSums()
```

There're only three NAs. Let's see them deeper before we decide to erase them.

```{r}
airports %>% filter(is.na(tzone))
```

As only three NAs exist, I think that's not a big deal if we search on Google to find their time zone. So, the results after performing Google search are as follows:

+ `"Dillant Hopkins Airport"`: its time zone is `"America/New_York"`
+ `"Mount Pleasant Regional-Faison Field"`: its time zone is `"America/New_York"`
+ `"Yakutat"`: its time zone is `"America/Anchorage"`

So, let's write down the updates in `tzone` column.

```{r}
airports[is.na(airports$tzone), "tzone"] <- c("America/New_York","America/New_York","America/Anchorage")
```

* NA Values in `flights`

```{r}
is.na(flights) %>% colSums()
```

We have a lot of NAs. Let's see them in more detailed.

```{r}
flights %>% filter(is.na(dep_time) | is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_time) | is.na(arr_delay) | is.na(tailnum) | is.na(air_time))
```

As too many NAs exist, it will be wasting information if they are dropped directly. Therefore, as the replacement for the NAs, we're going to substitute NA values in the `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` columns with measures of central tendency of each non-NA values, respectively. Subsequently, by using those substitutions of NA `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` columns, we will fill in each NA in the `dep_time` and `arr_time` columns, respectively.

First, let's check quantiles of the `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` columns before we decide which measure of central tendency we will use.

```{r}
quantile(x = flights$dep_delay, na.rm = T)
quantile(x = flights$arr_delay, na.rm = T)
```

It can be seen that both columns have a huge gap between center of the data and outliers. Thus, the use of median as a measure of central tendency is more recommended in this case than mean or mode measure.

Let's replace NA values in `dep_delay` with median of the non-NA values.

```{r}
mdn_dep_delay <- median(flights$dep_delay, na.rm = T)
mdn_arr_delay <- median(flights$arr_delay, na.rm = T)
flights$dep_delay <- replace_na(data = flights$dep_delay, replace = mdn_dep_delay)
flights$arr_delay <- replace_na(data = flights$arr_delay, replace = mdn_arr_delay)
```

Excellent! We've got `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` columns all filled in. Now, by using both columns added by `sched_dep_time` and `sched_arr_time` columns, let's calculate actual departure and arrival time for all NA values in `dep_time` and `arr_time` columns, respectively. Firstly, we need to convert `sched_dep_time` and `sched_arr_time` columns so that `hm()` function can be used.

```{r}
convertToHMchar <- function(input) {
   input <- as.character(input)
   browser()
   if (nchar(input) == 4) {
      output <- paste0(gsub("..$", replacement = "", x = input),
                       ":",
                       gsub("^..", replacement = "", x = input))
      
   } else if (nchar(input) == 3) {
      output <- paste0(gsub("..$", replacement = "", x = input), 
                       ":", 
                       gsub("^.", replacement = "", x = input))
   }
   browser()
   return(output)
}

#### you could also use codes below powered by 'stringr' package ##########################
#### they are more understandable but executed slower than functions of 'base' package ####
# convertToHMchar <- function(input) {
#    input <- as.character(input)     
#    if (nchar(input) == 4) {
#       output <- paste0(str_extract(input, pattern = "^.."), 
#                        ":", 
#                        str_extract(input, pattern = "..$"))
#    } else if (nchar(input) == 3) {
#       output <- paste0(str_extract(input, pattern = "^."), 
#                        ":", 
#                        str_extract(input, pattern = "..$"))
#    }
#    return(output)
# }

flights$sched_dep_time <- as.character(sapply(flights$sched_dep_time, convertToHMchar))
flights$sched_arr_time <- as.character(sapply(flights$sched_arr_time, convertToHMchar))
convertToHMchar(flights$sched_arr_time[4])
```

There's a problem. Rafael HernÃ¡ndez Airport, with BQN code, does exist in the `flights` dataframe, but it is not listed in `airports` dataframe. Therefore, we have to add manually a row in `airports` indicating BQN airport.

```{r}
airports[nrow(airports)+1,] <- c("BQN", # FAA code
                               "Rafael HernÃ¡ndez Airport", # Airport name
                               as.numeric(18.49486), # Latitude
                               as.numeric(-67.12944), # Longitude
                               as.numeric(237), # Altitude
                               as.numeric(-4), # Time zone offset from UTC
                               "N", # Does daylight saving time exist?
                               "America/Puerto_Rico") # Time zone
```



```{r}
airports[1,]
```

```{r}
airports[airports$faa == "BQN",]
airports[airports$faa == "EWR",]
```

```{r}
sprintf(fmt = "%02d:%02d", flights$dep_delay[1])

```

``` {r}
is.na(planes) %>% colSums()
```

``` {r}
is.na(weather) %>% colSums()
```

## Change Data Type



# Analysis



## Compare airlines' flights at each airport!

In order to answer this question, we need `arlines` and `flights` dataframe. Afterwards, we filter the data by its each year and each area. Next, for all rows filtered, calculate mean of salary for each job title in 12 months for each year, and then find the max salary from all averaged salary of job titles. The codes to perform these steps can be find below. Firstly, I create a function.

```{r}
head(airlines)
head(airports)
head(flights)
head(planes)
head(weather)
```


## Find the relationship between delays and weather conditions!



## Plot top 5 plane manufacturers causing delays the most!



## Show distribution of each airlines' fleets year manufactured!



## Show distribution of air times from three airports!



## Compare number of traffics among three airports!



## Create a map of the flights from NYC airports to other airports!
