# Capstone Project of Data Visualization Specialization

This repo consists of all folders and files required for the capstone project of [Data Visualization Specialization](https://algorit.ma/data-visualization-specialization/) at Algoritma.

The programming language used in this repo is R. The project output is a web shiny dashboard. I also wrote an R markdown file of this repo so that you can follow the steps to prepare the ready-to-plot data. I published the shiny dashboard on shinyapps.io website here `not published yet`. In addition, I pubslished the markdown either from the following links:

* [GitHub Page](https://utomoreza.github.io/DV_LBB/): `not published yet`
* [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/utomoreza/DV_LBB): `not published yet`

Feel free if you'd like to clone or download the repo.
